## My process

I have fun learning with each mentor frontend challenge

### Built with

- simple HTML page with script tags
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Axios - API
- React
- React-bootstrap


### What I learned

<div>
  It was a very interesting challenge to practice API uses with axios y React.js.

### Continued development

I feel compeled to try implementing a translation API and make this app available in my language (portuguese). I'm also looking forward to add a "Light mode" button.
